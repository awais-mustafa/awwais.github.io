In this guide, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through the process of setting up and configuring an NFS server on Linux.Here are the step-by-step instructions for\nsetting up: an NFS server and client on different machines #comment Step 1: Install the NFS package: On the machine that will be the NFS server, install the NFS package. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install the package using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server On the machine that will be the NFS client, install the NFS client package. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install the package using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install nfs-common Step 2: Create the Export Directory Next, create a directory that you want to share with the client machines. In this example, we\u0026rsquo;ll use /var/nfs/share as the export directory. Run the following command to create it:\nsudo mkdir -p /var/nfs/share Step 3: Configure the NFS Exports File The NFS exports file determines which directories are shared with the client machines. Open the file /etc/exports with your favorite text editor and add the following line:\n/var/nfs/share 192.168.0.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) This line allows machines on the 192.168.0.0/24 network to read and write to the /var/nfs/share directory. The rw option allows read and write access, the sync option ensures changes are immediately written to the disk, and the no_subtree_check option disables subtree checking.\nStep 4: Restart the NFS Server After making changes to the exports file, you need to restart the NFS server for them to take effect. Run the following command:\nsudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server Step 5: Configure the Firewall By default, NFS uses TCP port 2049 for communication. If you\u0026rsquo;re using a firewall, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to open this port. Run the following command to open the port using UFW:\nsudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/24 to any port nfs Step 6: Mount the NFS Share on the Client Machine Finally, you can mount the NFS share on the client machine. Run the following command:\nsudo mount 192.168.0.10:/var/nfs/share /mnt This command mounts the /var/nfs/share directory on the NFS server at IP address 192.168.0.10 to the /mnt directory on the client machine.\nConclusion Setting up an NFS server may seem daunting at first, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually a fairly simple process. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you should be able to configure an NFS server and share files with client machines in no time. Good luck!\n","permalink":"http://awaismustafa.com/blog/nfssetup/","summary":"Introduction: Are you looking for a way to share files between multiple machines in a network?NFS (Network File System) may be just what you need!
