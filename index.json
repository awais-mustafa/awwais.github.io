In this guide, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through the process of setting up and configuring an NFS server on Linux.Here are the step-by-step instructions for\nsetting up: an NFS server and client on different machines #comment Step 1: Install the NFS package: On the machine that will be the NFS server, install the NFS package. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install the package using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server On the machine that will be the NFS client, install the NFS client package. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install the package using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install nfs-common Step 2: Create the Export Directory Next, create a directory that you want to share with the client machines. In this example, we\u0026rsquo;ll use /var/nfs/share as the export directory. Run the following command to create it:\nsudo mkdir -p /var/nfs/share Step 3: Configure the NFS Exports File The NFS exports file determines which directories are shared with the client machines. Open the file /etc/exports with your favorite text editor and add the following line:\n/var/nfs/share 192.168.0.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) This line allows machines on the 192.168.0.0/24 network to read and write to the /var/nfs/share directory. The rw option allows read and write access, the sync option ensures changes are immediately written to the disk, and the no_subtree_check option disables subtree checking.\nStep 4: Restart the NFS Server After making changes to the exports file, you need to restart the NFS server for them to take effect. Run the following command:\nsudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server Step 5: Configure the Firewall By default, NFS uses TCP port 2049 for communication. If you\u0026rsquo;re using a firewall, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to open this port. Run the following command to open the port using UFW:\nsudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/24 to any port nfs Step 6: Mount the NFS Share on the Client Machine Finally, you can mount the NFS share on the client machine. Run the following command:\nsudo mount 192.168.0.10:/var/nfs/share /mnt This command mounts the /var/nfs/share directory on the NFS server at IP address 192.168.0.10 to the /mnt directory on the client machine.\nConclusion Setting up an NFS server may seem daunting at first, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually a fairly simple process. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you should be able to configure an NFS server and share files with client machines in no time.
